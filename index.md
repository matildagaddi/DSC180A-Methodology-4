#### What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
It has been very interesting to learn the math behind various distribution comparison functions and learn their pros and cons for different datasets and applictaions.
#### Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
It would be interesting to investigate using KAIROS for identifying the most valuable datapoints in a training dataset and target these with SAVAGE for poisoning, then assessing how well KAIROS does in valuing and identifing the perturbation.
#### What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
I might like to change what datasets we are using and see in we can incorporate ones that are more related to social issues.
#### What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I would be interested in learning about best practices in running many ML experiments and documenting the processes we are doing.
